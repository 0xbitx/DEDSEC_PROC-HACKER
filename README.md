### DESCRIPTION

PROC-HACKER is a Linux-based command-line tool designed to provide comprehensive and detailed insights into system processes. It displays a wide range of process details, including CPU usage, memory consumption, open files, network connections, thread information, and more. This tool is incredibly useful for developers, system administrators, security professionals, and digital forensics experts who need in-depth visibility and control over running processes. With its hierarchical tree-like display, ProcAnalyzer makes it easy to trace parent-child relationships and understand the behavior and impact of each process on the system.
